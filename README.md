# Image classification with label noise on CIFAR100 dataset

### Installing prerequisites

The prerequisite usually refers to the necessary library that your code can run with. They are also known as `dependency`. We have prepared a few libraries for you to start with. To install the prerequisite, simply type in the shell prompt (not in a python interpreter) the following:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

This model uses a modified dataset [CIFAR100-NoisyLabel](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar100-image-classification-with-noisy-labels/data)

Each line of the dataset's `csv` file follows the below format:
```
filename,classname
```

## Image classification with dataset of noisy labels

Perform image classification using the given dataset of noisy label version of CIFAR-100 dataset (`cifar100_nl.csv`).

`REPORT1`: Describe model your have used (1. architecture overview, 2. any specialty of this model and etc.)

`REPORT2`: Report both the training and testing accuracy in a plot (x: epoch, y: accuracy). 

`REPORT3`: Discuss any ideas to improve the accuracy (e.g., new architecture, using new layers, using new loss)
